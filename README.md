Master Thesis Repository

Overview:
This repository contains the implementation scripts which is used in this research. This repository consists Python code to perform two different implementaion techniques to categorize Stack Overflow titles. Implementation A with word2vec with SVM is a mixture of unsupervised NLP technique for keyword extraction and supervised algorithm SVM to classify the titles based on the trained labels (Category). Implementation B uses LDA topic modeling to automatically classify the titles. The visualization and performance evaluation is carried out for both the methods and also included in the Python script written in Jupyter Notebook.

Steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install and import the required libraries.
3. Download the CSV files uploaded for both scripts.
4. Read the CSV file containing dataset in the script based on the file path.
5. Run the Python scripts to execute the Python codes.

Note:
There is a wait rtime for some visualization to execute.
There are two different scripts for both implementation techniques.
